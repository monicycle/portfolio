      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>Venus came to ThoughtWorks with the desire to implement a global DevOps strategy in order to facilitate more automated, rapid and predictable delivery for IT responsiveness. My team and I evaluated organizational readiness, observed and captured areas of improvement for delivery practices, and assessed the efficiency of current processes through workshops, team interviews, and one-on-one conversations in 5 business units across 3 countries.</p>

      <h2>Our Approach</h2>
      <p>We call these types of engagements “Discoveries,” where our goal is to learn about organizational culture, common tools, evolving practices, and inescapable pains. The deliverables we create from these Discoveries are less catered to recommendations for specific individuals or teams; rather, we look at the organization as a system and identify key issues that need changing to become a responsive organization. </p>
      <p>Over the course of two months we conducted the following:</p>
      <div class="full-width-bar"><img class="body-image" src="https://i.imgur.com/KhFo5D2.png" alt="total interviews employees workshops" width="100%" /></div>
      <p>The depth and breadth of our interactions with Venus' teams varied based on what setting we were in. Interviews allowed us to capture culture and interaction patterns as well as gain insight into current capabilities and opportunities for improvement. The Agile Maturity Model assessment established a baseline of process maturity for Venus and was used to measure process improvements. The Path to Production Workshops explored a specific delivery project's process flow to pinpoint where teams spend the most time. </p>

      <p>Through our research we discovered 18 dimensions that corresponded with improving the organization’s responsiveness. Each of Venus’ recommendations tied back to one or more of these 18 dimensions.</p>

      <h2>Findings</h2>
      <p>Despite the organization’s focus on DevOps, we observed an alarming average of approximately 80% of time spent in planning activities, rather on building technology itself. We found opportunities to improve efficiency and reduce the cost of IT in all dimensions. For example, capacity was lost in the overhead associated with context switching. Regardless of an individual's role, context switching across multiple projects incurs a tax on productivity that wastes capacity. Addressing the root cause problem of too much work in process is fertile ground for cost savings and increased business value.</p>

      <h2>Impact</h2>
      <p>We presented our findings at a Global IT Board meeting where we collaborated with 17 professionals from Venus. The goal of the workshop was to help the organization increase the pace of change and reduce the cost of IT by gaining knowledge from the ThoughtWorks discovery and aligning on recommendations to move forward. Our workshop was hands-on and entirely collaborative.</p>
      <p>We achieved this by:</p>
      <ul class="list-content"><li>Introducing the ThoughtWorks discovery findings</li>
          <li>Identifying high value opportunities for Business Units to increase pace of change and reduce cost of IT</li>
          <li>Identifying common opportunities across Business Units (if any)</li>
          <li>Aligning on what support (if any) is needed from Global Competency Centers</li>
          <li>Aligning on metrics to track progress on improvement activities</li>
          <li>Aligning on next steps to pursue high value opportunities</li>
          <li>Each Business Unit prioritized their top three Themes and Recommendations and identified their Next Steps to grow their organization.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>After successfully completing our global discovery, we engaged in several other projects with Venus. </p>
