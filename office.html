      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>ThoughtWorks San Francisco needed an office that reflected an investment in employees, clients, and the community at large.</p>
      <p>This is my story of designing and project managing the buildout of the ThoughtWorks San Francisco office, and what it means to apply user-centered design to physical spaces.</p>

      <h2>The Approach</h2>
      <p>We wanted to transform the way ThoughtWorks SF employees <em>(called ThoughtWorkers)</em> interacted with the workplace: feel more connected, inspired, and creative through meaningful interactions.</p>
      <p>In order to define what "meaningful interactions" people needed, I created various feedback channels: led interviews with former designers and project managers, created personas, ran workshops, and conducted usability tests.</p>

      <h2>User Research</h2>
      <p>I interviewed three people who managed office designs: two ThoughtWorkers and one external project manager. These conversations highlighted focus areas to devote more time to, particularly on how to manage a tight budget while delivering on a highly sensitive timeline.</p>
      <p>However, beyond being "on time" and "on budget", the conversation got me thinking: <br>
        <em>How might we incorporate the opinions of vastly different users (Thoughtworkers, clients, community members) under one roof?</em></p>
      <p>Our initial stakeholders were quick to decide how the office should be built. Over the course of several weeks (and many meetings), I was able to advise our stakeholders on a more user-centered approach that incorporated fast feedback from ThoughtWorkers. Based on a series of interviews, I generated user personas for the types of employees in the office and I presented them to the stakeholder team. This design decision grounded our stakeholders and ensured we were always making decisions for the office at large, and not just for ourselves.</p>

      <p>Generating user input required hosting evening workshops with an office design team to ideate on potential features (rooms, spaces) and receive feedback on preliminary designs. These workshops were hands-on, where my team and I would draw out space plans, construct lookbooks for particular rooms, and then discuss the most important insights to bring to the stakeholder team. Our process was democratic and inclusive, in hopes of ensuring all opinions were heard.</p>
      <p>When my stakeholders and I felt confident in the prototype (initial space plan), we tested the plan on eleven employees who walked us through how they would navigate the space. It was powerful to use this technique on an architectural project because it saved our team time and money, gave us feedback early on in the process, while also getting people more acquainted with the progress on the space. Our usability tests shed light on several final tweaks made to phone rooms, surfaced a need for non-bookable meeting rooms off of the gathering space, and a renaming of the two workstations (from beach/permanent staff to collaborative/quiet). </p>

      <p>Our final design plan included:
        <ul class="list-content"><li>an open floor plan</li>
            <li>large gathering space to hold meetups and events</li>
            <li>workstations separated by working-style (louder, more collaborative versus quieter, more individual)</li>
            <li>large communal kitchen area</li>
            <li>community board</li>
            <li>gender neutral bathroom(s)</li>
            <li>wellness room</li></ul></p>

      <h2>Impact</h2>
      <p>After the completion of the office in July of 2015, ThoughtWorks San Francisco has become a landmark in the fusion of tech, social justice, and art. More than one-third of the 11,000-square-foot office is dedicated to flexible, communal gathering space for partnering with and fostering local social justice organizations. The other two-thirds of the space are a mixture of meeting rooms and workstations on an open floor plan for maximum flexibility. </p>
      <p>In 2016, ThoughtWorks San Francisco was awarded two design awards by the International Interior Design Association: the GIVE AWARD (honoring Social Responsibility projects, "any project with an emphasis on improving the physical space’s impact on society") and the PEOPLE'S CHOICE AWARD (chosen by the general public through online voting). The San Francisco office design is now being used as a model for our client strategy on how to help our clients improve their technology organizations by building or redesigning offices with a user-centered approach. </p>
