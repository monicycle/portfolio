      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>ThoughtWorks San Francisco needed an office that reflected an investment in employees, clients, and the community at large.</p>
      <p>This is my story of designing and project managing the buildout of the ThoughtWorks San Francisco office, and what it means to apply user-centered design to physical spaces.</p>

      <h2>The Approach</h2>
      <p>We wanted to transform the way ThoughtWorks SF employees <em>(called ThoughtWorkers)</em> interacted with the workplace: feel more connected, inspired, and creative through meaningful interactions.</p>
      <p>In order to define what "meaningful interactions" people needed, I created various feedback channels: interviews with former designers and project managers, created personas, ran workshops, and conducted usability tests.</p>

      <h2>User Research</h2>
      <p>I interviewed three people who managed office designs: two ThoughtWorkers and one external project manager. These conversations highlighted focus areas to devote more time to, particularly on how to manage a tight budget while delivering on a highly sensitive timeline.</p>
      <p>However, beyond being "on time" and "on budget", the conversation got me thinking: <br>
        <em>How might we incorporate the opinions of vastly different users (Thoughtworkers, clients, community members) under one roof?</em></p>
      <p>Our initial stakeholders were quick to decide how the office should be built. Over the course of several weeks (and many meetings), I was able to advise our stakeholders on a more user-centered approach that incorporated fast feedback from ThoughtWorkers. Based on a series of interviews, I generated user personas for the types of employees in the office and I presented them to the stakeholder team. This design decision grounded our stakeholders and ensured we were always making decisions for the office at large, and not just for ourselves.</p>

      <p>Generating user input required hosting evening workshops with an office design team to ideate on potential features (rooms, spaces) and receive feedback on preliminary designs. These workshops were hands-on, where my team and I would draw out space plans, construct lookbooks for particular rooms, and then discuss the most important insights to bring to the stakeholder team. Our process was democratic and inclusive, in hopes of ensuring all opinions were heard.</p>
      <p>When my stakeholders and I felt confident in the complete preliminary design, I returned to my office design team where I conducted a series of usability tests. I printed a large copy of the physical space plan (see below) and asked the users to take me through a walk in the office. After a few moments of discomfort, all users were able to harness their imagination and walk me through what they thought the space entailed, and what it seemed to be missing.</p>
      <p>Through this research we discovered that the most important facet of the new office was: compelling people to stay or inspiring them to come back. We realized some employees preferred to use the office in a quieter way, whilst others were constantly pairing and collaborating; therefore, we wanted to appeal to both working styles. People also mentioned wanting a space with compelling artwork, more meeting rooms and a space for people to connect in person.</p>

      <h2>Emerging Themes</h2>
      <p>Over the course of our research, several Themes began emerging and are captured below. Each of these themes ties back to one or more of the 18 dimensions and requires specific capabilities to become a responsive organization. Within each Theme, we explain Venus' problems in detail, and then describe what "good" would look like for an organization like Venus. We then list what needs to be done for Venus to get to that state.</p>

      <h2>Impact</h2>
      <p>We presented our findings at a Global IT Board meeting where we collaborated with 17 professionals from Venus. The goal of the workshop was to help the organization increase the pace of change and reduce the cost of IT by gaining knowledge from the ThoughtWorks discovery and aligning on recommendations to move forward. Our workshop was hands-on and entirely collaborative.</p>
      <ul class="list-content"><li>Introducing the ThoughtWorks discovery findings</li>
          <li>Identifying high value opportunities for Business Units to increase pace of change and reduce cost of IT</li>
          <li>Identifying common opportunities across Business Units (if any)</li>
          <li>Aligning on what support (if any) is needed from Global Competency Centers</li>
          <li>Aligning on metrics to track progress on improvement activities</li>
          <li>Aligning on next steps to pursue high value opportunities</li>
          <li>Each Business Unit prioritized their top three Themes and Recommendations and identified their Next Steps to grow their organization.</li>
