      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>ThoughtWorks was approached by a financial services company to ensure better compliance practices through tracking regulatory information on a native iOS app. I joined the team after the initial product was released to a select group of people, and was responsible for expanding on the mobile feature set and creating a version for iPad. With several untested design files inherited, I was responsible for validating the current design, improving the user flow, and figuring out the best way to better prepare executives for high-profile meetings.</p>
      <p>My team consisted of:
      <ul class="list-content"><li>1 Product Lead</li>
      <li>1 Business Analyst</li>
      <li>6 Developers</li>
      <li>1 Experience Designer</li></ul></p>

      <h2>What's the Problem?</h2>
      <p>Our client was having difficulty preparing executives for important meetings with global regulators: information went missing, outputs from previous meetings went uncaptured, and the messaging was inconsistent across different audiences. For a client of this scale, the lack of foresight was costing them millions of dollars in reacting to last-minute changes. We were tasked with using the original product as a catalyst for a more comprehensive way to prepare global executives for important meetings, so that the organization would move to becoming more proactive.</p>

      <h2>User Research</h2>
        <p>In order to build the right tool, we spoke to everyone involved in meeting preparation: from designing the slide decks to capturing meeting attendance to the presentation script itself. We conducted 9 user research sessions with users of different hierarchies in the organization.</p>
        <p>Some themes that emerged were:
          <ul class="list-content">
          <li>5 of 9 Desire for a standard way to deliver/read source materials</li>
          <li>5 of 9 Need for previous notes to prepare for future meetings</li>
          <li>8 of 9 Lack of visibility into the stages of the preparation process</li>
          <li>9 of 9 Process takes longer than expected</li></ul>
        <p>From the interviews, I was able to craft a journey that captured different user touchpoints.</p>

      <h2>Workshop Design</h2>
      <p>The research gathered from our interviews informed the design of our workshop. Our workshop had 6 client participants from regulatory affairs and compliance and 3 ThoughtWorks facilitators.</p>
      <div class ="full-width-bar"><img class="body-image" src="https://i.imgur.com/AbxgwSX.png" alt="workshop template" width="100%" /></div>
      <p>We split the workshop into two main parts, one for capturing key metrics and the other for capturing additional problems. For metrics, we used the Lean Value Tree as a way to connect our clientâ€™s goals to tangible measures of success. From there, we derived hypotheses that could correspond to features. We also decided to take a step back and see how the entire meeting preparation process could be improved, so we created a User Network diagram and highlighted problems to ideate on.</p>
      <p>After synthesizing the data, we learned the most value we could bring to our client was with more thorough meeting preparation, allowing all participants to be informed and stay on top of their relationships. We also planned for using machine learning as a way for our users to address big ticket items and become more responsive.</p>

    <h2>Product Design & Development</h2>
      <p>While we continued to develop new features for the mobile application, I was also looking at ways to improve the meeting participant experience by developing an iPad alternative. Through research we leanred that all users who attend high-profile meetings had iPads, which they preferred to use for slide decks and skimming long-form information. We held weekly usability sessions where we tested new features for the iPad and validated former iPhone designs. I built the protoype in Sketch and then uploaded the files to Invision for an interactive prototype. The product was tested with people who used the app with varying frequency.</p>
      <p>Any large-scale UI changes required transparent communication with the development team, either through designer to developer pairing or holding a UI update meeting to capture feedback from all developers. Holding an open line of communication allowed for design to be a more collaborative process and made it easier for the team to decide how to release features most effectively.</p>

    <h2>Learnings &amp; Successes</h2>
      <p>As consultants, we strive to bring value to our clients by building products that matter to their users and strengthen their business. Working on the regulatory app taught me how to toe a line between business needs and user needs, and constantly champion our users even when that wasn't what the business wanted to invest in. At the end of our time with the client, we had eliminated archaic excel spreadsheets with a desktop tool to collect data and thus supply the app with on-demand up to date information.</p>
      <p>Of the 243 users we had 64 active users (logging in 2 times per week) within two months, giving our client a better tool to becoming a responsive, and not a reactive, organization.</p>
