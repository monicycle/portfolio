      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>As a new resident of Brooklyn, and a commuter to New York City, I was intimidated to continue cycling. On walks to the subway, I would survey the neighborhood and take note of how pedestrians, cyclists, and cars responded to each other. The frustrations between each of the three groups was palpable, with everyone getting upset at the other in in almost everyt neighborhood. Instead of being overtaken with complacency, I decided to take to the streets and speak with other cyclists about bike safety.</p>
      <p>My goal in this research was to:</p>
      <ul class="list-content"><li>Identify why people cycle in Brooklyn and what concerns they have</li>
          <li>Understand how people stay safe on the road</li>
          <li>Learn how people (would) respond if a crash occurs</li>
          <li>Understand when and why people break traffic laws</li>
          <li>Identify what areas of Brooklyn bring cyclists the most concern</li>

      <h2>What's the Problem?</h2>
      <p>In 2014, Mayor De Blasio created the city program "Vision Zero," in an effort to decrease traffic fatalities by 50% before 2025. The program encompasses both pedestrian and bicycle fatalities.</p>
      <p>At the start of this research (November 2016), there were a total of 17 cyclist fatalities in New York City, up from 14 in 2015. In addition to the 17 lives lost, 4,342 cyclists were injured among the three Burroughs of New York City.</p>
      <p>If New York City is to ever reach Vision Zero, we need to better understand what concerns cyclists and pedestrians have, especially in notoriously unsafe intersections. Rather than researching prevention of fatalities, I wanted to dive a little deeper into what happened <strong>after</strong> the 4,342 crashes.</p>

      <h2>User Research</h2>
      <p>I interviewed five cyclists in Brooklyn over the course of one week. Most cyclists were in their late twenties and early thirties, and identified themselves as casual riders (15+ miles per week). The following patterns emerged:</p>
      <ul class="list-content">
        <li>50% did not know what information was necessary after a crash</li>
        <li>50% pulled their phones out while cycling</li>
        <li>80% had been in a crash before (not limited to BK)</li>
        <li>Everyone used their smartphones for directions</li>
        <li>Everyone expressed feeling unsafe when riding at night</li></ul>
      <p>There were resounding concerns about Atlantic Avenue, a well known thoroughfare in Brooklyn that connects a majority of Brooklyn over its 7.4 mile stretch. When asked why cyclists broke traffic signals, all respondents said: “It’s a matter of safety. I’d rather run a red light and know i’ll clear the intersection and ride without cars around me, than wait for a light and risk riding with traffic.”

      <p>From these interviews, I created an Empathy Map to better understand what a user goes through on their daily commute:</p>
      <div class="full-width-bar"><img class="body-image" src="https://i.imgur.com/rWh4jHl.png" alt="empathy map of Brooklyn cyclist" width="100%" /></div>

      <p>By extrapolating from my Empathy Map, I was able to explore several different points of views from potential users. With those new perspectives, I developed a series of “How might we” design statements:</p>
      <div class="full-width-bar"><img class="body-image" src="https://i.imgur.com/kotMHYL.png" alt="How Might We statements" width="50%" /></div>
      <p>From these insights, I decided to focus on: "How might we better equip our users on how to respond to a crash?"</p>
      <p>This statement tied directly back to the 4,000+ crashes in New York City this year, and how to help people respond safely.</p>

      <h2>Ideation</h2>
      <p>Based on Ellie's experience from the empathy map exercise, I decided to create a storyboard to see what her day-to-day on the bicycle would look like.</p>
      <div class="full-width-bar"><img class="body-image" src="https://i.imgur.com/TgCdiSN.jpg" alt="storyboard" width="75%" /></div>
      <p>From here I decided to brainstorm, and created a series of sketches of possible solutions to explore. I time-boxed myself to 10 minutes per page, with two iterations. Some solutions were entirely out of reach, but I drew them anyway to keep the ideas generating. </p>

    <h2>Crash Guide Results</h2>
      <p>The lo-fi sturdy spoke card solution stood out to me the most, because it would inform cyclists on how to respond to a crash without having to involve technology. This way, if a phone were lost or unusable in a crash, he or she would still be able to respond.</p>
      <p>When looking over other crash guides, I felt lost in all of the text — there was little to no information hierarchy. I researched various government resources on what information individuals need after a crash and met with my interviewee. I gave him the following scenario:</p>
      <p>You were about to cross the green light when a car, who you believe was not signaling, made a right turn into you. You hit the pavement but feel fine, though your bike looks nearly totaled. The car stayed on the scene. What do you do from here?</p>
      <p>“I wish I knew. The information [in the old guide] isn’t available in a way for me to respond quickly, especially given my emotional state after a crash.”— Park Slope resident, 32</p>
      <p>This feedback helped propel me to organize the crash response information with a friendly yet informative tone. The guide I designed is laid out based on a timeline from "Now", when "Police Arrive", and "After". This helps the user quickly see where they are in the crash process and what they need to do. For the "Now" section, the user is given an option between "hit and run" or "car on site" because the information they need for the police is greatly different based on the type of crash. From there, a user is guided through the information process, so that they don't feel overwhelmed. The guide highlights each interaction with a specific icon (i.e pen for writing down information), so that they can easily scan the document and see where they require action. </p>

    <h2>Crash Guide Results</h2>
      <p>I reached out to Transportation Alternatives, an organization I later began volunteering for, to receive feedback on the guide, and was met with great enthusiasm. The Transportation Alternatives team made a few suggestions, and then asked to use the guide for city distribution. At this time, the guide has been mass printed and distributed to local biycle organizations and companies in the city. </p>
