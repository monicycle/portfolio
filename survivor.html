      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>Dating and the internet make for a powerful pair. We have the ability to connect with more people than ever before, which feels both exciting and intimidating; however, it may also lead us in harms way. A friend and fellow survivor of sexual assault approached me after seeing my <a href="##">Crash Guide</a> and asked if we could create a similar guide for victims of sexual assault.</p>

      <h2>What's the Problem?</h2>
      <p>Every 98 seconds a person in the United States is sexually assaulted (DoJ). The topic has gained serious momentum over the past year, where people are speaking out against the lack of accountability of sexual assailants. We have seen victims of sexual assault speaking out in educational institutions, public offices, the movie industry, and beyond. </p>
      <p>The moments after an assault are particularly painful, where victims are left trying to make sense of what happened, struggling to define if their experience matches the dictionary definition of “rape” or “assault,” and pained by the long journey of recovery ahead of them. Available resources are either ineffective or lacking. Moreover, the social media indurstry that powers a significant portion of how we connect and stay connected provides little to no support for victims who report -- sometimes, even refusing to take down their assailant’s profiles.</p>

      <h4><em>
        Note: Sexual violence is notoriously difficult to measure, and there is no single source of data that provides a complete picture of the crime. On RAINN’s website, we have tried to select the most reliable source of statistics for each topic. The primary data source we use is the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), which is an annual study conducted by the Justice Department. To conduct NCVS, researchers interview tens of thousands of Americans each year to learn about crimes that they’ve experienced. Based on those interviews, the study provides estimates of the total number of crimes, including those that were not reported to police. While NCVS has a number of limitations (most importantly, children under age 12 are not included), overall, it is the most reliable source of crime statistics in the U.S. We have also relied on other Justice Department studies, as well as data from the Department of Health and Human Services and other government and academic sources. When assembling these statistics, we have generally retained the wording used by the authors. Statistics are presented for educational purposes only. Each statistic includes a footnote citation for the original source, where you can find information about the methodology and a definition of terms.</em></h4>

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p><strong>Literature Review</strong></p>
    <p>I created a spreadsheet that captured sexual assault news articles and resources. Over the course of a few weeks, I read about the current state of reporting sexual assault in the US and Europe, specifically around dating apps. All articles were logged with names, a summary, themes, author, date, and a link to the piece directly. Once I had a better understanding of the problem, I explored what resources are available for victims. Most resources pointed me in the direction of <a href="https://www.rainn.org/">RAINN</a>, an anti-sexual violence organization.</p>

    <p><strong>In-Person Interviews</strong></p>
    <p>My partner met with a victim of sexual assault and asked her a series of open-ended questions about her experience. The interview was enlightening, but also very triggering for both the interviewer and interviewee. We learned that after our interviewee was sexually assaulted, she was unaware of what to do to press charges or seek medical help, and spent several weeks avoiding the topic because she saw it as a hindrance to completing her masters program. We decided not to hold more interviews because the subject was triggering to our own mental health.</p>

    <p><strong>Interviews with Resource Centers</strong></p>
    <p>With a general understanding of what a victim’s experience looks and feels like, I called RAINN (1-800-656-4673) and connected to sexual support centers in: New York, California, Iowa, and Texas. After disclosing my location by zip code I was connected to a representative that was required help me receive help after an assault. I disclosed the research project with every phone operator, and asked them to treat the situation as if I had just been assaulted, in order to get a better idea of what they do to help.</p>

    <p><strong>Reporting Flow for Dating Apps</strong></p>
    <p>I then looked into the process of reporting on dating apps: <em>How easy is it to receive support from these companies? Are there any resources available on the website? </em></p>
    <p>Both flows for Tinder and OkCupid were intuitive, where a user handles reporting through the other user's profile. I did not follow through with a report on a user, and therefore asked a friend to walk me through the process. I went through the stages of blocking and reporting a user, however did not complete the action because I did not want to wrongfully accuse someone for the sake of a process flow.</p>
    <p>An interesting feature I noticed with Tinder was if an attacker "unmatches" with a victim, all of their correspondence will be wiped and there will be no way to easily file the report via their attacker's profile. This requires the user to submit a report via their general help@tinder.com email.</p>
    <p>Both websites did not provide any support resources for victims of sexual assault.</p>
    <img src="##" alt="##" width="100%" />

    <p><strong>User Journey</strong></p>
    <p>From the information above, a user journey was created and refined capturing actions, feelings, etc. Based on our findings, we decided the biggest opportunity to provide victims support is "After" the assault as they begin to "Reflect & Recover". We then focused our energy on the major components of "After": making sense of what happened, seeing a doctor, reporting the assault to authorities, and seeking mental health help.</p>

    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p><strong>Content</strong></p>
    <p>We began consolidating useful information into four resource brackets: introduction, medical help, legal help, and mental healing. Most of the information came from government and nonprofit websites that had conducted recent research studies, like RAINN and Victims of Crime. We pulled the highest priority information based on our user journey that we later displayed in a more user-friendly way. By using Google Docs, my partner and I were able to collaborate real-time. The comments section allowed us to stay engaged while both of us were working our day jobs.</p>

    <p><strong>Wireframes</strong></p>
    <p>My partner and I collaboratively sketched over Google hangouts to identify the direction of our protoype. We ideated 10 minutes per section (introduction, medical, legal, and menthal health), drawing as many solutions as possible on several sheets of paper, and then presented our sketches. We discussed our individual approaches and then agreed upon a final protoype design.</p>
    <img src="##" alt="##" width="100%" />

    <p><strong>Usability Testing</strong></p>
    <p>Our final prototyp was then tested with six different potential users of the product. We wanted to ensure that we had a diverse user group, so we ensured there was representation from different genders, sexual identities, ages, and backgrounds. The usability testing is still in progress...</p>
