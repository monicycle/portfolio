      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>My client was a global investment bank headquartered outside of the US with an office in New York City. Our work was centered around the “Control Room”, a segment of the compliance organization that manages highly sensitive deal-related information on employees and companies.</p>
      <p>We built a responsive web application for the Control Room to track Material Non-Public Information (MNPI) requests in order to give the bank more visibility into who has what information across the organization. Prior to our engagement, all MNPI requests were tracked over email, running the risk of sending highly sensitive information to the wrong person by selecting the wrong name via email. Our tool was to standardize MNPI requests globally, where we gathered key input from users in the US, Brazil, UK, China, and Switzerland, and tailored a solution that benefitted all parts of the organization (back office and front office).</p>
      <p>We were met with an enthusiastic stakeholder team that quickly adopted agile practices, surprised by the level of transparency and engagement in our meetings. Our development team was based out of the ThoughtWorks NY office, with regular (and eager) visits from our users and client team.</p>

      <h2>What's the Problem?</h2>
      <p>Companies with listed securities need protocols to ensure there are tight controls around how they handle insider information. Strict controls help prevent information leaks to the public, which have massive effects on the market. Given our client was managing their MNPI requests over email, there was a huge risk involved in information getting to the wrong parties and a massive opportunity to collect data on who in the organization is regularly requesting for information. Our client was frustrated with the entirely manual, tedious process to handle wall crossings and the lack of standardized information needed to wall cross someone which created a bottleneck of multiple follow-ups.</p>

      <h2>User Research</h2>
        <p>A few design methods we used were:</p>
        <ul class="list-content">
          <li>user interviews</li>
          <li>process flows</li>
          <li>personas</li>
          <li>usability testing</li>
          <li>design charettes</li>
          <li>design critiques</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our first priority when working with the client was to identify the process flow for requesting an individual to be wall crossed. We spoked to twelve people across the global Control Room to capture the any slight differences between regions. We then synthesized those insights, sketched a complete process flow, and validated it with the final stakeholder team. We used this approach for capturing process flows for two other types of wall crossings. In total, we identified the process for requesting a traditional wall crossing, vetting, and inadvertent.</p>

        <p>Usability testing was a significant factor in user research. Given I was the only designer on the team, our research process was run very lean, where I ensured to meet with users across all roles and regions whenever there was a new feature idea to be tested. Our primary users were the global Control Room team (those who process the wall crossing requests); however, there were other users across the business ranging from the requesters (private side employees requiring public side SMEs), crossees (public side SMEs), and conduits (supervisors of the public side SMEs). The prototypes for testing were created in Invision and tested on desktop and mobile.</p>

      <h2>Interaction Design</h2>
      <p>We built the tool responsively because we knew that several user groups required mobile access; otherwise, the tool would not be usable. Given this, we wanted to create the simplest way to deliver a holistic view of Over the Wall life cycles to enable a better bank strategy, from the comforts of your computer or phone. During testing, we made users prioritize the importance of wall crossing information, and identify which information could be simplified in the mobile view. Ultimately, the most important interaction for mobile was to approve or deny a wall crossing while on the go, which needed the user to look over the request in its entirety. </p>

    <h2>Style Guide</h2>
      <p>Halfway through the engagement, a new ThoughWorks team began working on a living style guide for the bank. This was a huge opportunity to not only to standardize the look and feel of all internal applications, but also cut down on developer time by having components readily consumable. I collaborated with the style guide team in order to influence the design direction with my own insights: we held regular catchups and design critiques to ensure consistency. Ultimately, once the style guide team completed their work, I made it a priority to incorporate the work into our current product, in order to prove to the client the benefits of having a living style guide. Given some of our developers did not have the strongest front-end skills, the style guide enabled them to focus on system integration while handling the styling for them.</p>

    <h2>Learnings &amp; Successes</h2>
      <p>Building the wall crossing tool helped shed light on how imperative it is to not only confirm a process, but continue referencing it in case inconsistencies arise. Given we were building an greenfield tool, we were replacing an entirely personalized e-mail request "system" to something... well, rigid. With rigidity came great responsibility to guarantee that the tool would satisfy user's needs of fulfilling a wall crossing request, while also allowing for <em>some</em> flexibility in the process. Our application was built with the ideal path in mind, making it hard to bend when edge-cases occured. The last few weeks of the project were a scramble in ensuring that all but the most unlikely of edge-cases were covered.</p>
      <p>The tool was positively received when we completed our intial engagement in December of 2017. The "friends and family" release entailed a user base of 20+ individuals across the organization, growing at about 15 users per week. In the last week of delivery, our users successfully wall crossed three employees, as they slowly began transitioning off of email and onto the tool. The tool will be available for the entire bank (~30,000 employees) by March 2018.</p>
