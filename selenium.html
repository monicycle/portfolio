Selenium redesign
</h1>
<p>
  Web developer, 2019
</p>

<p>
I paired with an engineer to redesign the Selenium HQ website. We wrote custom CSS based on high fidelity mockups made by another designer and built the application in Hugo to ensure Selenium staff could update content with ease. This was my first time working as a web developer and it really put my CSS to work. <a href ="https://www.selenium.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check it out live!</a>
