        <h2>The problem</h2>
        <p>Drata’s original compliance dashboard wasn’t meeting the needs of our Compliance Manager persona. Key information was either buried or absent, making it difficult for users to quickly understand their organization’s security and compliance posture.</p>
        <p>Worse, some of the data presented could be misleading—creating confusion and risking a loss of trust in the platform. This was a missed opportunity to deliver immediate, actionable insight in a space where clarity and accuracy are critical.</p>

  <h2>Discovery</h2>

  <div class="card">
    <div class="content">
      <h3>Review existing research</h3>
      <p>I started by reviewing existing research across Gong, Slack, and internal documentation to understand what wasn’t working with the existing dashboard. While Drata hadn’t consistently grounded projects in user problems before, I wanted to ensure we were solving the right one.</p>
      <p>Through this investigation, I aligned with leadership on a shared definition: a dashboard should highlight what needs attention and make it easy to act. For our Compliance Manager persona—especially in SMB and Mid-Market segments—the primary goal is maintaining audit readiness.</p>
      <p>This insight led to a clear hypothesis: We needed an operational dashboard—one that immediately flags issues and enables fast resolution.</p>

      <h3>Audit existing dashboard</h3>
      <p>I audited Drata’s current dashboard to evaluate how well it met the core user need: “show me what I need to fix.”</p>
      <p>What I found was a largely non-operational experience. Aside from prompting users to fix integrations, most of the content duplicated navigation elements or surfaced low-value metrics—offering little actionable insight for compliance managers.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <h3>Usability testing</h3>
      <p>Following contextual inquiry, I designed and tested multiple dashboard iterations focused on key user jobs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Seeing audit readiness by framework</li>
        <li>Identifying which tests need fixing</li>
        <li>Prioritizing upcoming tasks</li>
        <li>Understanding the overall state of their compliance program</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Each version was reviewed with engineers, internal users, and leadership to ensure alignment and effectiveness.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Compliance work is largely tactical—managing and preventing failures.</li>
      <li>Cumulative failures lack context and aren't helpful for assessing progress.</li>
      <li>Users need to understand why something changed to take meaningful action.</li>
      <li>Prioritized, grouped data enables more efficient workflows.</li>
      <li>Drata is often used reactively, triggered by email or Slack notifications.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Solution</h2>
  <p>To support the dashboard redesign, I updated and extended our design system — introducing new components, refining visual styles, and ensuring consistency across layouts. These system-level changes not only improved the dashboard experience but also gave our team reusable building blocks that sped up future feature development.</p>

      <h3>Gated Task List with Clear Statuses</h3>
      <p>The IT governance process spans several weeks and includes multiple steps, reviews, and handoffs. A task list provided a high-level overview of all steps in the governance journey while focusing the user's attention on their current step. It offered just-in-time clarity and helped reduce confusion, delays, and the back-and-forth that often occurred due to missing information or incomplete documentation.</p>

    <h3>A Back Office Tool for IT Governance</h3>
    <p>Because the gated task list required someone to advance Business Owners through each step, we designed a companion tool for the IT Governance team. This internal tool gave the back office a centralized way to manage all incoming requests. It allowed them to update task statuses, assign team members, track associated documentation, add internal notes, and send communications—all from one place. By replacing manual emails and scattered SharePoint files, the tool improved efficiency, reduced errors, and ensured smoother handoffs throughout the governance process.</p>

    <h3>Digitizing the Intake Form & Business Case</h3>
    <p>Two key documents in the governance process—the Intake Form and the Business Case—were originally completed in static Word documents. Business Owners often found the questions unclear, which led to frequent back-and-forth with the IT Governance team for clarification. To reduce friction and improve the quality of submissions, we digitized both forms. This included refining and simplifying the form fields, embedding contextual help and guidance, and adding error prevention features. The result was a more intuitive experience that empowered Business Owners to complete documentation confidently and correctly the first time—saving time for both them and the back office.</p>

  <h2>Impact</h2>
  <p>Measurements were collected over the course of a quarter, and we found that EASi was performing well for both Business Owners and back office staff. While the project concluded before we could evaluate year-over-year impact on shadow IT, end users reported improvements in usability, document retention, and overall process clarity.</p>
  <div class="metrics-section">
    <ul>
      <li class="metrics">21 of 21 divisions onboarded</li>
      <li class="metrics">85% completion rate</li>
      <li class="metrics">54% faster approvals </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Learnings</h2>
  <p>At the start of the project, our Product Owner advised us to focus primarily on the customer experience, noting that "the back office works for CMS and doesn’t need all the bells and whistles." Given the scope of generative research ahead, I aligned with that direction.</p>
  <p>However, a few months in, it became clear that while the back office team would be required to use the new system, they had significant needs of their own—needs that weren’t captured in our initial discovery. As a result, conversations with them became difficult and frustrating; we had unintentionally deprioritized a critical part of the service ecosystem.</p>
  <p>This experience taught me a lasting lesson: start with the back office. Understand their workflows, pain points, and priorities first. When their needs are addressed, the broader service experience becomes exponentially stronger. In this case, it took several hard conversations and a conscious decision to descope parts of the customer-facing experience to ensure a seamless transition for the internal team.</p>
  <p>In the end, we successfully replaced their tooling without disruption—but we learned the hard way that real service design starts from the inside out.</p>
